# School_District_Analysis
## Introduction

This analysis is performed on student data gathered from several schools including public and charter schools. These schools' budget is also included in the data to understand their effect on students' performance. Students reading and math scores are gathered in the data file as a measure of success for the school.

## Analysis and Results

The first thing is to import the data in the code and clean the data from any missing information. This is done by using the pandas library in Python. Next, we summarized the data to find the average, min, max, std, and more information on math and reading scores. Then we drilled more into the data and looked for minimum score, average score for each school, and grade. The number of students and the budget of the school are the parameters that might affect the student's overall scores, so in the last section, we drilled further into these two variables.

## Future Analysis
Students' performance depends on several factors such as the number of students in each grade and the budget of the school. It is a good idea to find the average of the scores for each school and plot these data.
